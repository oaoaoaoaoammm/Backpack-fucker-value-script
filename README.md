I won't sign for a long time for the sake of some 5-minute script, I'm too lazy
# How do I run this script?
1. Open this backpack
2. ~put C4 in there~ open any pair
3. ``ctrl + f12`` or in simple words, open the console
4. ``ctrl + c`` + ``ctrl + v`` + ``enter``
5. leave the tab open and continue to surf the Internet

   
[```for (var i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {```](https://github.com/oaoaoaoaoammm/Backpack_fucker_value_script/blob/main/backpack_fucker_value.js#L47) - where ``i <= 100000`` is the volume

everything else is signed, figure it out for yourself
